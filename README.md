# DoorLockSystem---Arduino-Project
This is a project that I made during my 2nd year in college while I was studying about drive elements, AC and DC motors and thei applicability in our day to day life.

For this project I used the following components:
- Arduino board
- breadboard
- 2 LED lights --> the GREEN one turns on if the password is correct and RED otherwise
- LCD display
- servo motor
- buzzer 
- wires
